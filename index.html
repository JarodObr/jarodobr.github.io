          Hello, my name is Jarod. I am not very big with programming but i took this class anyways.
          Not the best strategy but it seems pretty cool so far.
          I am a freshman hoping to go into Aerospace Engineering.

          My favorite activites are:
          -Video games
          -sleeping and
          -listening to music
